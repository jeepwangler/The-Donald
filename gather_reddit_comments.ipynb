      "I've been depressed for many years... hated my job, hated college, (took me eight years to get an engineering degree), hated the direction the country was going in (SJWs, identity politics, etc; I'd lost hope).  This election required voters to think critically; we had two very distinct choices for the first time in 40 years... and we won. My hope has been restored, my confidence in the country somewhat, and my personal confidence as someone who predicted he'd win in 2015 has been majorly, to the derision of my own family, who are mostly republican, totally restored. I'm contemplating taking another sick day. Many things went well for me today; I took it off mostly because I'm sooo bored at work, and always tired (I use little vacation or sick time); and because it was Election Day.  I wanted my happiness of not working karma to flow to trump. Not only did I fix a broken tool, I fixed a broken truck that sat idle in my yard for four months, and the COUNTRY WENT MAGA!  I've always wanted to run my own business: today has me feeling the confidence to do so!  I've been right now, more than I've been wrong. My family thought me crazy when I said Trump would win (way back in 2015 when he announced). Trump, however pitiful this sounds, has made me believe in myself again. I feel, under his presidency, my only hinderance to success is me. I can accept that. I cannot accept an oppressive government doctrine and be happy.\n",

As you enjoy your victory please remember to be kind to folks on the other side! We all need to work together now and come together behind president trump to try and help all Americans out! If your victory turns into a condemnation of your fallen foes then you'll end up no better that the business as usual Washington insiders you so strongly dislike.
